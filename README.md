# Building
SystemUI Tuner makes use of hidden APIs in Android. To avoid reflection, a special SDK JAR is used to directly access these APIs.
To successfully build, you'll need to grab the Android 12L (API 32) JAR from [here](https://github.com/Reginer/aosp-android-jar), and follow the instructions to install it.
